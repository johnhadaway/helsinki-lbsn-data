# LBSN data concerning Finland's Capital Region

The datasets here were proccessed and analysed as part of the University of Tampere's *Muuttuva käsitys lähiöstä tiivistyvässä kaupungissa (Changing perceptions of the suburbs in a condensing city)* project, which is part of the Ministry of the Environment's Suburb Programme 2020–2022 and funded by the Housing Finance and Development Centre of Finland (ARA). The datasets are derived from cumulative observations of venue activity, as of 01/01/2022, retrieved via the Foursquare Places API. The bounding box for these observations are as follows (WGS84): SW (60.059, 24.485), NE (60.585, 25.226). 


The observations were elaborated using a methodology for categorisation described in "Optional and necessary activities: Operationalising Jan Gehl’s analysis of urban space with Foursquare data," written by Damiano Cerrone, Jesús López Baeza, and Panu Lehtovuori (Cerrone et al. 2020). Using its methodology, venues were categorised into 10 buckets, each mapping to an urban activity. The buckets, together, are an approximation of "all activities capable of being performed in the city," combining Jan Gehl's categorisation with more recent research (Cerrone et al. 2020). The buckets are as follows: *Taking care*, *Income*, *Nutrition*, *Mobility*, *Education*, *Civic*, *Leisure*, *Social*, *Consumption*, and *Personal care*. A description of each of these buckets can be found in the table below (Cerrone et al. 2020).
